Every day General Grievous adds a unique lightsaber to his collection. Day 66(Finale): Every u/Raymesiris suggestion.

u/Thibson34 has reddit premium for life from these posts
So were all getting this on a t shirt right? I know one of you quarenteend at home has a screen press. Let's get this started
My lightsabers have doubled since the last time we met, r/PrequelMemes
u/Thibson34: *stops the series*

General Grievous: Goodbye old friend, may the force be with you
And thus it was, the Fourth Age of r/prequelmemes began. And the Fellowship of Grievous, though eternally bound by friendship and love, was ended.

Nine and a half weeks to the day, since Thibson sent us on our long journey, we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight. We were home.

How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on, when in your heart, you begin to understand; there is no going back.

There are some things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep... that have taken hold.

Grievous once told me, his part in this tale would end. That each of us must come and go in the telling. Grievous’ story was now over. There would be no more journeys for him... save one.

My dear r/prequelmemes, you cannot always be torn in two. You will have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be, and to do. Your part in this story will go on.
So this is how General Grievous dies, with thunderous upvotes
66 Canon suggestions:

Um...66 lightsabers from unknown jedi that died in the temple in order 66?

(90 of my suggestions have been used).

Holy shit you could not have done anything better for the last day. This is the Smash Ultimate roster of finales! *They're all here!*

Thank you to everyone who saw my lists and made a suggestion, especially to those who made great canon suggestions I needed! And to those who made legends suggestions, they weren't forgotten! I made a legends list for april fools day.

And a massive thanks to u/Thibson34 for everything. I never thought I could use my Star Wars knowledge for something this fun and also this popular, and I even learned a bunch about Star Wars canon *and* legends for this.

I promise I'll pinpoint which lightsaber each of the new ones are, I already recognize a bunch of the new ones!

Edit: Cal's orange lightsaber, near the bottom and pointing upwards...oh it's beautiful.
The karma is strong with you, a powerful Redditor you will become. Henceforth you shall be known as Darth Thibson34
Jedi Bob and the Schwartz Ring are bottom right
When you see the Lego lightsaber at the bottom

A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
this is reddit history right here
It's beautiful. You can either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain, and you chose the death of a hero. You have my sword.
Did you ever hear the tragedy of u/Thibson34 the wise?
After all these years...

Finally, I have them all
When Thibson finally adds the Schwartz Ring

*ah, victory*
Day 66? You are a bold one.
*JEDI BOB IS HERE*
Grevious: * completes collection *

Thibson: *The mission... the nightmares... They're finally... over..*


Edit: damn, first gold, thanks

Execute Order 66

Edit: HOLY CRAP  MY FIRST GOLD! THANK YOU KIND STRANGER!
Well, there are quite a lot of things I want to say, so sit tight.

To start it off, I want to thank everyone who engaged in this series of memes. You made these two months some of the best in my life and it was absolutely amazing. I also want to give very special thanks to u/Raymesiris, u/StemmedAxis, u/Black-Forces-God, u/radiakmjs, and u/hotpotatodude. You have engaged in unprecedented ways and were essential to making this meme what it is now.

Now, the decision to end the meme today may come as a shock to most. In fact, I wasn't going to stop today, until I was contacted by the moderators. They explained, in a very heartwarming message, that my posts were an exception to a could-be-seen-as violation of Rule 1(vote manipulation). They asked me to conclude it at day 66, so that this exception would no longer be in place. While a little frustrated, I understood that the rules were there long before me, and it would be unfair to continue opening an exception without good reason. That said, I would also like to thank the moderators for such an opportunity.

I also took the decision to not continue it in a dedicated subreddit. As far as my participation is concerned, this meme belongs to r/prequelmemes. I do, however, give full permission for you guys to continue it in another subreddit(It would probably be important to appoint someone to be in charge).

Now, as for the post itself, I decided to go out with a bang, by effectively doubling the collection at once. I used all of Ray's suggestions, as he was someone who maintained an amazing level of commitment ever since the first few posts. Thank you once again my friend.

I also added in the Jedi Bob lightsaber and the Schwartz Ring, as those were also suggested by very committed and engaged users.

I would like to apologize for all of you who suggested lightsabers in the Suggestion Board and whose suggestion never made it. It wanted to make a "every suggested lightsaber" instead, but I simply didn't have enough time. But once again, thank you for your commitment!

Now for some shameless advertising: I invite you guys to check out my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqd1cEseKkmDJh901jSwnA). It doesn't have any content YET, but I will soon release some music covers, arrangements, remixes, and compositions. So if you are into that kind of stuff, subscribe. I will also make a video talking about this whole grievous experience, which should be pretty interesting.

To conclude, I hope everyone is safe. Stay at home and take care of your elders. These are thought times, and I feel extremely gratified to know I made it a little bit better for many of you. You sure did my time a lot more fun!

Ps: This isn't a goodbye! I'll still be active in the subreddit, and posting memes whenever an idea pops into my head!

Edit: Fun Fact the file size was so big Reddit wasn’t accepting it, so I had to decrease the quality.

Edit 2: RIP my inbox

Edit 3: Anyone wanna calculate the amount of coins spent on this post?

How many lightsabers did you add?
Me to my grandkids :
Have you heard the tragedy of u/thibson34 the wise ?
Grandkids : no.
Me : I thought not. Its not a story the mods would tell you. Its a reddit legend. u/thibson34 was a dark lord of the redditors so powerfull he could add infinite lightsabers to Grievous to influence his karma. He had such knowlegde of the dark side, he could even create an exception to rule #1.
I think I just witnessed history.
When u/Thibson34 could keep going on for ever and getting Karma but instead pulls out all the stops for a great Finale  

“You are strong and wise, and I am very proud of you”
I think this is a nice compromise. Some wanted more, some were tired of these. This was the final bang to put things to an end.
u/Thibson34 was a hero. I just didn’t see it
Grevious' Lightsaber Collection? My goodness, you've grown!
*"Oh, it's beautiful"*
We are part of the history bois
Congratulations u/Thibson34, you are now the record holder for the most awarded reddit post ever.
Farewell old friend. May the force be with you
Day 40 of asking for LEGO Jedi bob... oh wait it’s here sweet this has been a long ride and I loved every second of it.
This ended better than the Disney trilogy...
Does he have the infinity blade yet?
last
This is still the most popular post of all time in r/prequelmemes. The mods have gone too far. We stand with you.
[removed]
Mods should sticky this post for probably a week, at the very least. This is r/prequelmemes history.
Petition to give u/Thibson34 emergency powers and be hailed supreme chancellor
Now officially the most awarded post on Reddit with more than double it's closest competitor.
I’m a total Star Wars noob. Just know the movies and whatever lore I learn on here. So I learned a lot about lightsabers. Until there were so many and I didn’t know which one was the new one, so I just assumed it was the weirdest one...

Top memedom!
Whipes tears*  *"beautiful"*
Obi-wan is gonna have a hell of a time cutting all those arms off

It's treason then
*When you realize this is u/Thibson34 's last post*
"Goodbye old friend, and may the force be with you"

Thank you dude for doing this. Not everyone loved it, but I was one of the many fans of this. The vast collection of lightsabers is astounding and I thank you for enlightening me. So again goodbye old friend. And may the force be with you. Always.
Most awarded Reddit post of al time?
Anyone here after he got banned
We miss you old friend
Where is Thibson...is he safe?...is he alright?
I've been looking forward to this
I see u/Thibson34 will never see an ad again on Reddit!
Justice for Thibson34
Apparently every post is unarchived so hello
WAIT YO WHY CAN I COMMENT ON THIS?? ITS A YEAR OLD??
Now begins: Every day Obi Wan chops off an arm off General Grievous for 66 days.

u/award-cost-bot
Can't imagine mods banned him today
F
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Thibson34 the arrogant? I thought not, it’s not a tale the reposters would tell you, it’s an OC legend. Thibson34 was a user on r/PrequelMemes so skilled in photoshop and creativity that he could add a lightsaber to General Grievous  every day for 66 days to generate... karma. Indeed he had such a knowledge of the OC that he could be given awards out the wazoo. Eventually he became so popular that he became arrogant, unfortunately he got too big for his britches and mouthed off to a mod and got permabanned. Ironic, he could bring karma to himself, but got banned in the end.
In one year from now, do an encore and add the lightsaber spoon from the cereal boxes when The Phantom Menace came out.
The time has finally come.
Finale?

A surprise to be sure, but a tearful one.
"Where were you when u/Thibson34 stopped adding lightsabers?"

"General Grievous meme is kill"

"No"
Most awarded 🙏
Well this post now officially has the most awards on Reddit ever having broken the previous record more than 3 times over. Congratulations u/thibson34!
You sir are a legend
RIP the legend
Mods: BANNED
Where the beginning of the end started
Twice the pride, double the fall
The good old days
Let's go this is un-archived and I can comment wooooooh
This got the “unobtanium” award. That’s a test award for award animation. This post is getting awards that aren’t even LEGAL. AWESOME
I was never brave enough to comment on any of your posts, but let me say: This has been quite the ride. I’m happy that we were able to make your days a little brighter. Thanks for these memes, friend. The Force will be with you. Always.
[deleted]
Did you ever hear the Tragedy of u/Thibson34 the wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Mods would tell you. It's an r/prequelmemes legend. u/Thibson34 was a Dank Lord of the Meme, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the lightsabers to create a collection... He had such a knowledge of the dank side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dank side of the Meme is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his subreddit everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save jokes from death, but not himself.
Into exile, he must go. Succeeded, he has.
How long does your premium last
Cmon only 7k more upvotes till top of sub.
u/award-cost-bot
u/Thibson34 Congrats for reaching top of all time.
Why did they ban him ?
u/award-cost-bot
u/award-cost-bot
And now he's banned lol
How high up is this post on the list of most awards ever received?
How long until the archive!?
A fine addition

These Grevious memes are getting out of control and I love it
Holy shit this is amazing. Any explanation on how you did this?
Ob god the coughing while he jumps! That's some S tier shitpost. Super rare these days.
This is epic
This is pretty high effort. See you in hot.
You fool! I was trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku!
This is top of r/PrequelMemes material holy
Thank you for this.
Grevious survives after order 66. He collects all the lightsabers the jedi have dropped. However, he could feel nothing. All the sense of accomplishment... For what? All he could feel now was that he just wanted more of them. He hunts down remaining jedi, and adds enough collection to decorate his entire palace. But still, only hollowness.

The Empire falls. He adds two new collections, both red. Eventually, the sith fell. And Jedi rose once again. As Luke trains new jedi, he begins to hunt them down once again. However, it didn't went for long, as Kylo betrayed and first order brought the sith again.
Grevious wonders what's the ultimate goal of the universe. Do everything just cycle over and over? Then what's the meaning of his existance?

He grabs the lightsaber Kylo has dropped. He feels joy for brief moment. Just then, he realizes. It was his destiny. Keep collecting. Even if the galaxy falls apart, the joy of adding fine addition would never go away.
This is canon now.
This is so great
**Expectation**: Quarantine will lead to new discoveries in science that will help better the world

**Reality**: High quality memes
[deleted]
We don't deserve content this good. That \*\*cough\*\* on the dive? The Splash? Superb.
HAHA HAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA
Great editing!
Ben: *throws lightsaber into the ocean, never to be found again*

Grievous: G E T O U T O F M Y W A Y
Why does Kylo look extra green screened in this?
Saw this without sound, thought it was hilarious. Then I realized there was sound to the video. Then I died
I recorded Grievous's falling time multiple times and got an average fall time of 2.07 seconds. 

In order to determine the height that General Grievous fell, you can use the kinematics expression: height = (1/2) \* acceleration due to gravity \* time falling squared. This means that height = (1/2) \* 9.81 m/s\^2 \* 2.07\^2. 

Grievous jumped from about 21 feet into the ocean in order to retrieve Ben's lightsaber.
[deleted]
This will make a fine addition to my saved posts.
See you in hot
Your OC is very impressive. You must be very proud.
I just watched the movie and your edit had me laughing like the joker on meth.
These animations are very high quality. Maybe we need quarantine more often.

u/Yusi-D-Jordan just lost the top post on this sub after having it for a total of 2 days

what a time we live in
I can do this now
We are in a golden age and I am happy to be locked indoors for it
Ill see you guys on /r/all tommorow
Can we admire the absolute cannon of an arm Kylo has? He could throw a football over them mountains
*Gets eaten by a bigger fish*
Is there one for when Luke throws his LS?
he said okay bye
LMAO
I cried
I’ve never seen such finesse in a post, well done
Anyone shit themselves when he came running at the camera?
Im fucking crying man. Thank you, this made my day
Congrats dude, this is now the top upvoted post on Prequelmemes of all time!
Now do the same for when luke loses his hand
интересный
I can’t see through my tears!! I’m actually crying!
Hehe
Holy fuck this subreddit is poppin the fuck off today
This is the greatest meme I have ever seen
Great, but title spoiled the meme.
u/thibson34 has ushered in a new age in this sub
I just want to comment to be part of history
[deleted]
The noise he makes as he jumps into the water lmao
I haven't laughed so hard at something in a long time bravo
Congrats on top post of all time!
This is so good, I can't stop watching it
This is now number 1 on prequel memes
r/equelmemes
I thought that stop motion LEGO one was going to be the best one of the month. And here you go proving me wrong
Just watched the movie. Glad I did so that I understand your work.
This deserves to be the single most upvoted post on this sub
It’s beautiful
I can't explain why but I fucking love this
I actually laughed out loud for an inappropriate amount of time. Well done !
Some people think cabin fever makes people crazy, I think it made you a genius
I'M WHEEZING
That looks like Kylo Ren
This is legendary
Really thought he was going to run over Kylo
I like to think the general was somehow revived (Lazarus pit style) after RotS, at the cost of his sanity. He returns in a Gollum-like state of mind and now roams the galaxy in a junk freighter, obsessively collecting lightsabers.

Not many people have seen him, but mothers still tell their children not to stay out at night, 'or else you just might be unfortunate enough to hear a distant cough... and Old Man Grievous will make lightsabers from your bones.'
Really good editing. This was so fucking amazing.
Take my upvote
Can I upvote twice? Is it possible to learn this power?
Can someone explain why this is amazing? I have never seen a Star Wars movie.
u/vredditdownload
*CLICKITY CLACK*
This is the first Grevious lightsaber collection memes that has made me laugh.
u/Yusi-D-Jordan now needs to remake his animation but with a crossbar lightsaber added on
Anyone who does video editing have any idea how they masked Kylo at the end there? There's no way they just pencil masked him for each frame.
Oh god why is there a white outline around him in front of the Death Star? 

Also these memes are incredibly impressive and they motivate me to improve my shitposting skill.
Brother?
O...M...F...G....you deserve those awards ! That was outstandingly hilarious
This sub is so high quality lately. I'm glad you guys have so much time now.
This is from the directors cut, right?
Why the fuck we got such fine quality videos recently?

We got the Grevious with like 800 lightsabers a few days ago, Grevious spinning the sabers and getting absolutely destroyed and now this.

This subreddit is on a fucking roll.
Holy frik this blew up
This sub is really delivering lately

This is probably the best star wars meme i have ever seen

1000000000000 times better than the real movie
Ok, at this point, you guys are going to make a full length movie, and it will be better than the sequel trilogy.
Kylos face is the best at the end, “Again Grievous really dude?”
This is better than the entire sequel trilogy.
Would of made the movie better
This is the best thing ever

Coronavirus is perhaps the best thing to ever happen to this sub
I fucking love all these lightsaber memes
OP, you are a God among men, thank you for this gift
...To my collection.
This is absolutely amazing
Crazy when you think about how Ben Solo/Kylo Ren lived in the same universe.

Possibly the best prequel meme i have seen ever
He had the upper ground
That was great.
Lmao this will never get old.

GOLD
I thought the grevious series couldn't get any better but boy I was wrong. This is hilarious.
Amazing
Your meme will make a fine addition to my collection
Isolation is making us better. Imagine what we'll create in a month's time.
That was hilarious, saved.

This is the funniest star wars memes I've ever seen
Bruh his cough as he plunges into a dive! 😂

Epic meme

Rise of grevious collection deleted movie
Fuck you. I hope your family has a very nice christmas.

This meme brought me back to prequel memes after years on hiatus
Finally a quality grevious meme! I’m so tired of Thibsom spamming
Omg that’s perfect!
Nice
Fetch!
I legit thought it was gonna be Ariel from the little mermaid finding it.
General Grievous, your shorter then I expected
I'm so happy that masterpieces can emerge from one simple innocent shitpost.
Thanks dude. I needed this.
This shit is getting out of hand
I'd love to know how this was animated.
Username checks out. Well done.
Whats happening here?
Time to abandon ship!
This is too good.

This sub is masterful at the moment, quarantine truly does have a plus side, apart from not dying.
Sexy high quality video memes! I'm rock fucking hard right now! I could seriously spend a whole day talking about how much I love this, but literally nobody has the time for that, so just imagine the highest praise possible and assume that's what I mean when I say I 

#***FUCKING LOVE THIS POST!!!***
Can this be topped?
These just keep getting better and better.
This is fantastic
*cough *cough *splash
Holy fuck
Magnificent
So this sub is r/highqualityprequelgifs now?
I’m staying at my parents house for the weekend and their room is right next to my room and it’s 1am here and I laughed waaaaayyyy to loud at this and may have woken then up. Thank corona virus for keeping my parents awake.
This is absolutely incredible. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at something from this sub
The cough and wheeze as he jumps is what completes this for me.
For fucks sake man you made me lose it
Ya know how on Reddit you exhale loudly? Well I just fucking laughed so hard.
This is so cool my guy!!
What movie
Keep them coming. I'm loving these Grievous memes.
This is fucking brilliant
It’s crazy what we can do when we don’t have to go to school or work
"Never let a good lightsaber go to waste" - General Grevious
Nobody give this more awards, there are exactly 66
Goddamn I just had one good hearty chuckle (and another and another, gets better every loop). Well done, 
very well done.
Saved. Hilarious.
This is one of the best things I have ever seen.
A surprise to be sure!
Going through a pretty rough time. Thanks for the first chuckle in a while stranger. Love this
U/thibson finding all these lightsabers
This is incredible
In all honesty, I don't believe there will ever be a better shitpost on this sub. Congrats, /u/Execute-order_66 I think you've won. This is amazing.
I'm really glad that ya'll stopped being shitty and made the content appear at the top of the window.

I paused this about 2 seconds in to make that comment. (not this one) and now that I've watched this... HOLY SHIT.

This is OC. I hope the person who posted this is the person who made it because it's great. If you're not.  You suck. You're a shit horse carrying the weight of creativity to it's destination.
god i love this sub.
Damn grievous got covid :(
This is perhaps the single best thing I’ve seen
I get the strong feeling someone's probably going to edit Rey's  farewell to the sky walkers sabers soon
I wanna save this so much
ANOTHER!
Goddamnit. I love it.
This is beautiful...what a time be alive!
God like
I made a thing

This joke is gradually improving. Visual is great, now I just want sound
Obi wan would have just shit his pants and died if he saw that
"You must realize, you are f***ed!"
Hot damn bro, that is seriously well done. Where'd you learn to do that?
You fool. I've been trained in your Jedi Arts by Count Thibson

Nicely done
Where is the squiggly one
Maybe it's just what I took but this gets funnier and funnier
Well this is fantastic.
The quarantine is a pathway to many abilities sun consider time consuming
Graphics/put onto the video are amazing
u/vredditdownloader
WHY HELLO THERE

It’s beautiful. I’ve looked at this for five hours now.
I've seen this meme a good amount of times now, but that is by far the best edit of it I've ever seen. Good job!
I don’t care what universe you’re from, you gotta love it!
https://youtu.be/HX0DDigasd0
This is the best one of these I have seen!
Damn finally a good edit of this.
Oh it’s beautiful....
Im just happy to see an orange lightsaber. It's like the one color that gets ignored except in legends.
The Council is pleased with your work
Are we blind?! Deploy the upvotes!
Dang, now he’s ALMOST a match for Obi
LOL does anyone else notice the droid in the back like "yo dude check this out"
I would help crowdfund this whole fight
This is so stupid. I love it!

A fine addition to the subreddit.
This is fantastic
WHY CAN I HEAR IT
Wow that's beautifully done! The arms are very impressive - you should be very proud.
Oh god oh fuck
Sometimes I wish I could do that in KOTOR closer to the end of the game when I have over twenty lightsabers.

Quality work.
Krennic: It’s beautiful
This is actual art...and better than any scene in the sequel trilogy
That’s so cool
u/vredditdownloader
Man, think of how much cooler the battle of Geonosis would look if all the Jedi had the various canonical Kyber colors instead of just blue and green.
Finally, some good fucking content. -Gordon Ramsay
The sub that continues to give
You see General Kenobi, you aren’t dealing with the average lightsaber-wielding asthmatic cyborg warrior anymore...
You made a LEGENDARY thing
Looks like Christmas!
YOU FOOL
If I ever cover Grievous on my YT channel again, I want to use this clip.
Ok, so this dude is sidious, and u/Thibson34 is plagueis
Antibacterial soap vs Coronavirus be like....
It’s... beautiful.
Hello the- oh fuck.
When Grievous decides to take his collection on a walk. This is sweet, I am going for Communication Design so I am just wondering if this was done with Adobe Premiere Pro? Aftereffects? I love how smooth it is.
TOP 1 in less than 24H, GJ
Only 1k away from matching the highest upvoted post ever on the sub. We can do this.
Obi-Wan: “Time to abandon ship”
It makes the Droid in the background even funnier

You have done well

Holy shit that’s a really good edit!
Now bring it all together
I made a throwaway account so I could upvote this twice. Professional looking well done
In all honesty this looks so damn smooth, you did very well on this

I really like how you did the perfect amount of bloom. Well done

You made *the* thing.
I freaking love this subreddit

Imagine going to a rave and seeing this guy waving all that around

The force is strong with this one
I like this thing you made
Finally, an edit that isn't just a picture and has the lightsabers igniting
Generalgbt Grevious
I like this thing. Thank you.
Holy fuck
This is now canon.
Good lord, that’s amazing.
General Christmas tree lol
Kenobi would still kick his asthmatic ass.
I guess that technically makes him all of the Jedi
They make me want a popsicle
u/Thibson34 IT LIVES
Obiwan would still tank him too
I think we can all agree we need a version with sound.
Nice
This is fuckin amazing
Omo
Oh my Obiwan
u/vredditdownloader
He would be unstoppable.
Attack, Kenobi
Incredible work!!!

Oh, it’s beautiful.
The Christmas tree I never knew I wanted

I love u Thibson34
*Hello there*
Goodbye Then *force jumps away*
Oh grievous tree oh grievous tree...
I did not know I needed a Christmas Tree General Grievous star until now.
u/vredditdownloader
I laughed so hard at this
https://youtu.be/Te7goyAnzAQ
I immediately knew what was gonna happen, and I still watched the gif load for a full minute (damn you slow internet). Was not disappointed. Excellent work!
Nice
See you in top
Its beautiful
u/vredditdownloader
Surely you must realize you are doomed
Oh no not good
Obi-Wan: ... Goodbye there.
Hello there! Merry Grievousness!
I laughed out loud. Thank you for that.
Insane edit, wow
No coins for award, best I can give you 🥇
Looks like a Christmas decoration with all those colorful lights.
i love this
this is beautiful
Anyone else scrolling through comments looking for thibson?
Great
I have been looking at this for five hors now
Ok now this is epic
I was waiting for someone to finally make an animation of this.

And someone finally did. And it looks amazing!
....five barrels?

Edit: fixed the number
You made a thing, in a place? Don’t like it? Try a new place at a different time
The animation is seamless!
OP this is amazing. Great great job
I love this so much
“Good grief”
bye there
This! This is art!
I will never watch this scene and not look at the 2 droids in the background lol
That looks so what the fuck!

What software did you use?
This is getting out of hand! Now there are 18 of them!
Hello there

Is possible to learn this power?
When the collection is complete
Holy h*ck
That was so well done, amazing hahaha
Oh it’s beautiful
Its more satisfying at 2x
Outstanding! I will watch your career with great interest.
You are strong and wise and I am very proud of you
Adding sound to this would be the cherry on top of this colossal, perfect sundae.
This is perfect.
I would definitely shit my pants if I went up against a dude with 24 lightsabers
Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection
Soon, Obi-Wan backed away in fear as General Grievous could no longer be seen. Instead, slowly approaching the Jedi was a ball of multi-colored lights
lol I actually wish this happened
u/vredditdownloader
This is friggin amazing! The only thing that rivals how impressive this, is the fact that this post has 350-ish comments, and not one General Reposti accusation. I salute you, fine sir!
Incredible.
Omg I just noticed the two droids in the back.
Ofc /r/prequelmemes are the true folk of culture. This post did so well here compared to actual subreddit comprising of starwars
u/vredditdownloader
HELLO THERE
He’s a like a Christmas tree. It’s glorious.
General Thibson!
What a fine collection. This great OP
I need this with sound
going a little deep there
No words...should have sent a poet....
This is truly the only post from reddit I've ever wanted to give an award for and yet here I am with no coins, this will be saved and shared with all my friends though.
The droid in the back is telling his friend to watch  his amazing transformation.
MAKE THEM SPIN
Good god. Those editing skills though.
Is there one with sound? Would like to hear the tunes of grievious finest in his collection
Can you do this while he spins all the lightsabers?! 😯
Hello there, 
This is beautiful
Hi! I made a meme using this as a template. Would that be okay?
Oh that Italian way to hold the saber behind, you nailed it

I like your thing.
Also watch out for the cough
That looks amazing!
This is glorious, have my last 100 tokens
Phenomenal
Masking looks really good OP can't imagine that was easy.
I've been watching this for 5 hours now. Its beautiful
Kenobi "oh fuk"
Is that thing the droidification of COVID-19? It's a hard fight but the human Jedis will win
So far, it has been worth getting the coronavirus just so that you would be given the time you needed to make this.
This deserves each and every award it has received
If I was Obi Wan you'd bet your ass I'd turn against the Jedi so quickly, I'd be like yo listen Grieves, im joining the dark side ok let's go fuck up yoda up just chill ok we cool now.
Just wow
I knew this was coming, and it did not disappoint
You sir have officially won all of r/prequelmemes. No, in fact, all of Reddit.
Imagine him fighting like 50 Jedi with all those arms, I’m thinking of so many tactical advantages/disadvantages!
You did it you crazy sone of a bitch, you did it
Holy gaucamole 87 awards dam
This is the most amazing thing Ive ever seen
That is.... Beautiful
How.. the fuck.. did you make this. It’s so amazing I want to change career paths now
Shut up and take my republic credits
Oh it's beautiful O_O
Hello there
This is what we need in these strange times. Just amazing
This is beautiful. Someone quick remake the movie.
“Kenobi”
Obi-Wan:




"fuck"
Oh, it's beautiful
Insert Neo in Matrix Reloaded: "hmmm upgrades"
"Attack, Kenobi"

"Oh, I don't think so!"
Adding a new lightsaber blade to Darth Maul everyday except I don't have patience to do it everyday so I just skip to Day 38 and never do it again

[deleted]
This is not getting out of hand. Now there's just one of them.
I've said this before: whoever decides to add one grain of sand a day to *that* picture of Anakin will break all records on this sub.
I like this guy.
It’s over Reddit! He reached day 38!
Grievous heavy breathing amplified
This is how you should do it from now on. Wish I could upvote you more.
My lord... is that legal?
When you indirectly caused the 4 most upvoted posts of the subreddit
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth u/Thibson34 The Persistent? I thought not. It's not a story the Mods would tell you. It's a Reddit legend. Darth u/Thibson34 was a Dark Lord of the Lightsabers, so popular and so persistent he could use the Lightsaber to influence Reddit to create upvotes… He had such a knowledge of the dark side of Reddit that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying in new. The dark side of Reddit is a pathway to many post some consider to be unnatural. He became so popular… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his fame, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice gained more upvotes in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from dying in new, but not himself.

edit: forgot to link the op of this comment u/Obi_Won_Kenobi
This is getting out of hand, now there are 38 of them
He can’t do that. Shoot him or something
I was about to click on your profile and upvote the rest of them til I saw that there weren’t any lol

Hey /u/DarkStormPT,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
You underestimate your patience!
Skip to day 501 next, we got 66 from Greivous
u/thibson34 ‘s Grevious: Finally a worthy opponent! Our battle will be legendary!
38  


3+8 = 11  
1 + 1 = 2

Always two there are, no more, no less
You were right about one thing. The amount of posts *was* short.
*spinning intensifies*

I’ll try skipping, that’s a good trick!

Bruh this stopped being funny after day 15 smh
[Day 66:](https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/7197541.jpg)
How dare you stand where he stood!
At first I downvoted.  

Then I read the entire title and upvoted.
You stand amidst u/thibson34 achievement not yours!
38 days + 2 = 40

*counts left* 21?

*counts right* 19... fair enough, I guess
I absolutely adore that this roflcopter actually has 38 blades.
We shall watch your career with great interest OP.

Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud. u/thibson34
I was going to be pretty annoyed if another Karan farm circle jerk just went.. it’s making this sub into some pretty low quality. Idk if its the new kids or what but this sub used to be great.
Smooth move padowan
A surprise to be sure
Splendid.
I counted them.

It checks out

(but why add 2 more on the left than on the right? Everything should be balanced)
Ahh yes, the negotiator

I say patience  


Welp...fuck me right?
You dare stand where he stood
Do a reverse one, remove one lightsaber a day till there be no more
Is this the Phineas and Ferb special
How the fuck is this one of the 10 most upvoted posts on the subreddit?
Hbffecfxss
u/UberPheonix
To all the people that counted, thought you were wrong, in then realized you're right.
This has 132k upvotes.

The poster has a grand total of 28k karma.

What the fuck reddit? How does this shit even work?!
This is the way....
A good post/comment
Do it
Why does this shit remind me of Hydrocarbons
It would make a fine addition to my collection
So youuuuuuuuuu’re the person that inspired that video meme.  Well played.
[deleted]
You missed an opportunity to end on an odd number and mess with everybody's OCD with an unbalanced lightsaber
You son of a bitch, I'm up-voting.
Have 38 versions of duel of fates playing all at once from different starting points. That is true power
r/madlads
Fuck these “add ___ everyday” memes
The Chosen One!
Damn, it's been a wild ride fellas, glad we finally got here.
Let's double it daily from here on out.
Now THIS is lightsabering!
Now this is shitposting!
you legend
This is why the heroes can’t stop the maul streak
You are strong and wise and I'm very proud of you
Good. Goooooood.
No day 66? :(
Patience, my young padawan
you actually added 39 of them
He should try spinning! That's a good trick.
You must be very proud
Now this issomething i can get behind
Geez on my phone I see almost 100 comments but no upvotes.  If this is true, yikes.
Dont accidentally turn that on in your pocket.
yoda chronicles darth maul in one picture
*Mods liked that*
He is too dangerous to be left alive
All you need to do you is just walk and get the kill
Is it possible to learn this power?
This is the way!
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
He's too dangerous to be left alive!
Please do legs now
Beautiful
Someone should make it everyday, but with Grievous. That would be hilarious!
Is this the title to the hot, new light novel from Japan?!
Battling the 66 grievous would result in a release of so much power, it could destroy not just the prequels, but the OT and sequels too!
You will never achieve perfection without Dedication.  
However you will achieve my upvote.
Nice
Wtf lol
Darth Simpious at the end but he didn't.
I love this, it’s perfect
We need someone to animate this
Where can I get this saber?
Damn he better be careful with that
Shit, this is good enough.
38 times the memes, 38 times the upvotes
W
How many layers of inbred memes are we on right now?
Wouldn't this be the superior lightsword? I don't think Grievous would stand a chance with 132 lightsabers, but Maul with 38 blades, that could work!
You're a bold one!
Light saber shield.  

So, why don't Jedi ever use shields?  After all, Gungans had shields during Battle of Naboo, so we know they existed.  And the history of sword combat shows how effective shields are.   Kind of an oversight there.
So are you supposed to just run really fast at people and try to cut them up like one of those watermelon slicers?
That would be more limiting than anything... they should all go out in odd directions...randomly
\*Ohhhh... Eh, OOOOOHHHHH. AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH. IHHH OHHH AAHHHHH...\* Intensifies
I think Maul is my favourite Star Wars villain especially after watching the clone wars.
I miss the old days when the subreddit used to actually be funny.
Darth Maul ahead of the game in social distancing.
for anyone who can’t find it, it’s in the middle of the screen the black thing with 38 red light beams coming out of it
That's a lightshield, also known and a pair of Raybans.
Duel of the fates plays 38 times
Phineas and Ferb Star Wars be like
This is hilarious, actually made my day
How do you upvote more than once?
u/DarkStormPT are you the guy I was talking to forever ago about this? It was just recently your cake day? You should’ve stretched it out and just farmed the karma
Oh.  I was wondering why I suddenly heard Duel of the Fates so loudly.
Just count backwards, more posts less effort.
SUBARASHI
very nice
Oh no.

The battle has come.
Try now kenobi
That title though. Amazing
u/Thibson34 you are no longer the KenOC. You have been replaced...
Imagine throwing this thing
Phineas and Ferb mode activated.
Oh, it's beautiful
When you have too many flies roaming around.

Bzzz.

Bzzz.
Skip to day 420
Lego star wars Darth maul eat your heart out
How dare you stand where he stood.
This is peak lightsaber perfection.
That baby would take a lot of batteries.
How dare you stand where he stood
This is getting out of hand now there are 38 of them.
I liked this before I even saw the picture, cause that sounds like me in a nutshell.
That Fineas and Ferb Star Wars story arc though
You'll have my lightsaber!
This is the way.
Now THIS is shitposting.
Are these the Sequels you speak of?
Yes
So this is how /prequelmemes die. With thunderes circlejerk memes.
At lease you're honest.
Now we just need someone to animate it
The new thibson_34
Good on you. Maths are correct.
I wonder how many kyber crystals would be needed to power that beast
Ferb:
I was about to say let’s not start this shit again
You should have done 37 (advanced humor)
Day 1 of asking for Jedi Bob’s lightsaber. 

Aw darn, he did add it. Well, that’s that.
Gillette 5000 Razer, The Best a Dathomirian can get!
How did you obtain footage of the Kenobi movie? Disney will have your head
Did anyone actually count them?! I cancelled my bamboozle insurance!
Alright who's going to edit the video with Duel of the Fates repeating on each ignition?

I mean "Hello There"
So aim for the hand in the middle?
Outstanding move.
 as if 38 voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced
I've said this before: whoever decides to add one grain of sand a day to that picture of Anakin will break all records on this sub.
At last I will have my revenge and have added more fine additions to my collection than that sstupid General with astma
Looks like something I'd see on the 4th of July.
Grevious be like: a fine addition
Can we go back to day 3? Things were slightly simpler then
E = mc\^2 ?
Looks like a house centipede
So, he just makes a lightsaber milipede and tosses it at you?

Fuck that, dark side prevails, I'll kneel for the empire, just kill it and all milipedes and I'll pay my taxes.
Your patience is very impressive you must be very proud
Can we call this the saber shield?
General Honesty!
Phineas and Ferb Star Wars Special intensifies
If you have this, then you just hold it out in front of you and you’ll always win. They’ll lose from exhaustion
Can we give Rey one more force power every day? Oh wait, she already knows them all
My lord, is that legal?
Looks like a lightsaber from phineas and ferb star wars episode
[FTFY](https://imgur.com/a/MAVRKij) (careful, NSFL!!!)
Every day*
Is it possible to learn this power?
I counted. It checks out.
I'm so proud of you
This is like key jingling retard humor
Lol I posted on the Grievous one about how stupid it was and how I could predict the next post. So many dislikes by the children...
Ah shit, here we go again
Is the kar-98 coming on day 39
Best reddit title I have seen in a while
I’m calling OSHA that thing can not be safe!
At what point do multiple lightsabers just become a shield?
God's work
General shitposti!
Make is 40 and rip his fingers off
Brilliant. I love it.
There's 39 -_-
You are the senate
What would Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon say if they saw this?
So I was going to say that you did too many after I counted 40. Then I realized my own ignorance in the ways of Darth Maul's light-saber which already starts with 2 blades.
Quality
Fuck I love reddit
Amazing
We will watch your career with great interest.
Aka the onioniser
How dare you go 21-19 and lie about it
Reminds me of [this](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SeparateMistyBorzoi-size_restricted.gif)
Why don't you add a savage to mauls lightsaber for the remaining days?
Like my trickshot  TikTok marcusiles_
Now this is content
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
He can't do that! Shoot him or something!
Now I want to see a Grievous vs Maul duel!
Kinda looks like a peacocks feathers spread open lol
Now do it with pool noodles.
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
Someone animate this.
Quality fucking content. But I hate to say that you shall never sit on Thibsons throne
Good.
 **Everyday** is an adjective we use to describe something that's seen **or** used **every day**. It means “ordinary” **or** “typical.” **Every day** is a phrase that simply means “**each day**.”
Swiss army sabre
*Duel of the Fates except it’s lightsaber hum earrape*

ALSO PETITION TO CREATE A “KENOBIIIIII” AWARD
Is this the Marauder from Doom?
Oh, shit. Here we go again!
Do the helicopter blade from rebels
Can’t wait for Day 39, saved.
Smart man, thinking ahead
At this point it’s just a lightshield.
This seems like a missed opportunity to turn this into a gif with each lightsaber ignighting one after another
YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!
At last we will reveal ourselves to the sub. At last we will have our revenge.
Really? Reddit? Now? Wow.
Remember that Phineas and Ferb + Star Wars episode? Then Ferb used that? Ah good times
This path to the front page is unnatural!
Ah yes
At this point it's basically a light shield that you cannot touch right
A man of culture
Ah yes, 66k upvotes, what a time to be alive
Outstanding move!
make his horns lightsabers
Discount Kylo-ren
They had us in the 1st half not going to lie
Iconic
lies! the title says you'd add it to darth maul, *not* his lightsaber!
I love how everybody is just going to keep giving these people karma when they’re whoring to be like u/thibson34
I could see a shield like this being in the universe, then the individual sabre beams just start rotating really fast around the centre like a propeller

*yoda not givin two nerf herders about ani going to the dark side.*
Fuck me I snorted. Yoda's little face. God, what a time to be alive.
Anakin accusing yoda of putting sand in his bed
You’re the Sith Lord !
Oh it’s beautiful.
Yoda so cute and does resemble that cat.
Leave Yoda alone! He just wants his ketamine!
That should be mace windu, not yoda
Truly wonderful the mind of OP is
This is a “master”piece


i’ll show myself out
this is the best thing ive seen all year. my 2019 is complete.
Damn, this is really good
Here's the [HD Source](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4xTwdPBQUY/?igshid=1mzdkub1vkx9l) for all younglings

Hey /u/0_darth_plagueis_0,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
This here is why I still subscribe to this subreddit.
god tier
This is one of my favorite pictures on the Internet. Yoda’s face is brilliant!
I HATE YOU!
taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake ooooooooooooooon meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-ow
One thing that artists keep messing up when recreating this meme is the cat (or others) expression, its not one of happiness or disgust... he simply does not know what is going on, and is trying to enjoy his salad.
It’s....so good
Magnificent
this is beautiful
That little puppet lookin ass thing with the weird laugh that sits near Jabba the Hut would be great for this.
YOU TURNED HER AGAINST ME
I was having an anxious moment at the end of my work day. I was really letting something stupid get to me. I opened the Reddit app to get my mind on something else and found this at the very top. 

EVERYTHING was instantly better. I actually laughed out loud. This is perfect. Thank you.
Fu Manchu Yoda
Lost his shit, young Anakin has. How embarrassing!
Ok this post has the dubious honor of being the very first meme I ever saved to my pc. I never save memes because I'm stupid stingy with my drive space. But this image is just too perfect!
DANG ITS THE MOST LIKED POST IN JUST A DAY
holy fuck this is hilarious
I SEE THROUGH THE LIES OF THE JEDI!
Reddit admins vs r/legoyoda
Looks like a courtroom sketch
This is amazing.
HMMM art, I seee HMMMMMM
#Petition to make that Yoda the new sub icon
Never have I seen the word "art" used so appropriately.
Some of the best shit on this sub.
The greatest r/PrequelMemes post of all time.
TOP2 of r/PrequelMemes in 13h. We gotta push it
Yes now the top post is no longer a shitpost
Why doesn't this have tons of upvotes ? This is brilliant Haha.
Everyone go home, this guy wins the internet today
Is that... legal?
Grant me the title of Jedi master! No
This is awesome
He sees through the lies of the jedi
Begun the hate has.
The karma is strong with this one.
We will watch your career with great interest
True Art.
❤️
Oh god, that Yoda face is perfect.
"You took everything from me!"
I love it so much
The meta is strong with this one.
This deserves more credit
u/solarflare87
Jesus protecting anikin from Satan
The meme potential... What have you done
Nailed it
I would by a print of this.
I would proudly display this in my house.  This is fucking art!
This is beautiful
Anakin: Laser sword!  
  
Yoda: Lightsaber.
[me and my spouse, discussing this post](https://imgflip.com/i/3g4vr5)
I find spin offs of memes hilarious
Art = "I could do on my phone screen
"You turned her against me!"

"Done that yourself, you have."
just a masterpiece
Hilarious and I love that this exists. I am however bummed it’s not Mace
Save Anakin's mother I will not. Whiny bitch Anakin is.
Oh my god this is incredible
that is legendary
God, I love this, the quality of the art is amazing bonus for the meme.
I am very impressed with the artwork, you should be very proud.
Yelling at me you are
This is, hands down, the greatest thing I’ve ever seen.
Holy heck this is amazing
Wait I saw this on Instagram
WON THE NET
Love it or hate it but its still good af

This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Help my fuck this is the greatest thing ive ever seen
This is magnificent...
Oh my god I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so hard at anything else in this sub
I love how it looks like one of those drawings from the Supreme Court
I've come across this 3 times in the last 5 minutes and laughed each time.
What is this based off of ?
I know this artist and he's been doing official Star Wars and Game of Thrones art for some time now. He's so good. [https://www.instagram.com/jbcasacop/](https://www.instagram.com/jbcasacop/)
I love how han solo looks like jesus
*It's over Anakin. High ground, I have*
So we are never using the blonde girl/cat one ever  again
Star Wars fans: “the current trilogy sucks”
Me and the other 1% of star wars fans that thought it was good:
rank of master you're not
Caption: "It's outrageous! It's unfair! HOW CAN YOU BE ON THE COUNCIL, AND NOT BE A MASTER!?!?!?" "Take a seat, you will"
I hope the artist draws another one with little Annie and Qui-Gon on the left instead.
Best content I have seen on this sub in a long time.
25 awards and 91.2k
Fucking hell, in 7 h this has become one of the top r/prequalmemes of all time.
Like young children, I do. Committed war crimes in Uzbekistan, I did.
I just sent this to every meme group message I’m a part of
On the council, you are not

Laugh at you, I will
Bro the medals on this post goddam Hero of War on reddit
Absolutely incredible. 

Reddit may have just peaked with this masterpiece.
I can't express with words how hard this made me laugh or how happy if makes me. This is pure fucking art in its highest form. Bravo sir.
Can't find words how perfect this is
This is the single greatest meme ever posted to this subreddit. Yoda looks utterly taken by surprise.
I clicked r/PrequelMemes, this was the first thing I saw and I don't need to see anything else.
maybe the greatest human creation to this point, imo
This wins the cake of the best post ive seen on reddit so far. 🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇
This is one of the biggest posts on Reddit ever
40 awards... Wow
Revived the subreddit, you have.
Holy shit.  


It's like A-Ha and Star Wars had a beautiful baby.
When you don’t get the rank of master but are on the council
The fuck are these awards lmao.. good art nonetheless.
Perfection.
New top post of all time
What is this and why is this interesting?
This is now the most upvoted post on r/prequelmemes of all time. Congrats.
TOP EVER POST !!
What? How can you do this?! This is outrageous! It's unfair! How can you be on the council and not be a master?!
The only way to make it better would be to put Luke’s food Yoda ate when they first met.
Any link or source?
i need the original **with the artist's credit** to share this beauty
Shouldn’t it be mace windu instead?
Switch obi wan with palpatine and yoda with obi wan
This just made my day!!!! But how many ways could this go?! I like the Windu idea tho!
This is beautiful
It's outrageous!
YEEEAUGH
LIAR!
Should make one of this with Luke and R2D2
This one is a keeper!
This is a beautiful sensual piece of art
“Jedi Master, you are not”
Yoda here are u?
This is unfair
Genius at work
This is amazing!
This is fantastic.
At first glance I thought they were Sam and Dean Winchester and wondered what Yoda is doing there.
Top shelf memes.
L m a o
yessssssssss
Interesting this is
Fuckin genius !
Take on me take me onnnnn
Im sorry for sucking but can someone explain what the cats - or in this case yodas - reaction is supposed to be? This meme leaves me lost always
First pic should’ve been obi wan saying “you were supposed to bring balance to the force anakin not destroy it!” And the second pic should’ve been anakin
Looks great !
yoda is pleased
i'm in love.
Holy shitttt
Damn this is next level
This made my day
Kill the younglings, I did. You did it as well!
Mmhmm, a new meme template, created, you have
Oh I wish I had gold to give!
Front page this shit!
EPIC
Outstanding, that is.
OP: Why is Yoda sitting at a dinner table?
On the council a seat you have, master you are not.
Outstanding
Bruh moment
Good one bro
🥇
Same
Top notch!  I'd love to see a SOA version of this.
Fucking food, finally some good.
This is incredible.
Looked like Vergil for a sec there
I straight up thought that was Dennis Reynolds from first glance
“He ate my cookie the little green dick!”
Glorious
Yoda's eyes are so well done.
You were the Chosen Pun!

It was said you would destroy the Memes, not join them!

Bring balance to the Subs, not leave them in darkness!
Taaaaake on meeeeeee
My new favorite take on this meme.
Is that Jake Peralta?
This is glorious.  
  
But it looks like Obi Wan has an extra joint in an extra long arm. Now I can't unsee it.
When the art is looks better than your future and it's not even that good 🤦‍♀️
This should be hanging in the Lourve
This is not right. This is UNFAIR.
This speaks to me
Birth of something new.
This is fucking fantastic.
Good god, I need this on my wall.

If he doesn't intend to sell it, he should do the right thing and do a high res scan.
Angry you are
Very cool art style.  Im jelly.
Epic!
This is outragious its unfair
There is another.
Should have been mace windu.
Snorted 16 lines I did. Overdose, I will.
HOLY SHIT!
This is the top post on all reddit rn lmao
"You said I was the chosen one!"
This is why I’m happy that we have the internet lol
Lee ah. Lay ah.
I hope you know I laughed alone in my room, fuck my life’s depressing
The rank of master, you get not.
This is fucking amazing. I'm using this for discerning the individuals worthy of my time. If they snort, they're in
Good fuckin christ that's entertaining
“THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! ITS UNFAIR! HOW CAN YOU BE ON THE COUNCIL AND NOT BE A MASTER!”
Omg I’m dead
Anakin: You said Skywalker was the One.

Yoda: the one... character you will ever be recognized for.
This needs to be canon
Seriously Bro u Made my fucking depressed day!! 
New screensaver inc
He no like his chosen one.
mmm, gremlin i am.

Meme invasion and winter's coming.
Impressive, most impressive...
He trolling...
Holy Yoda 😂🤣
Oh my god.
"What? How can you do this? This is outrageous. It's unfair! How can you be on a council and not be a master?"
When you’re denied the rank of master
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! ITS UNFAIR!
This made my day.
That is the best thing I've seen in a while is that.
Brilliant!!!
There is another
Flying by and I feel it for a month
amazing
I BELIEVE THE JEDI ARE EVIL

Then lost, you are
I've been laughing at this on and off for the last 3 hours.
Why does Yoda look like that kid from Stranger Things?
Good art
I used a random bot to colorize it for no good reason

Could've been worse

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EJNGDNfX0AED2mL.jpg:large
*I WILL BECOME THE GREATES JEDI EVER, YOU’LL SEE! YOU’LL ALL SEE!!!*
A-ha
He’s too dangerous to be left alive!
This is epic.
Ah, I see someone is keeping up with the facebook.
This has been and will always be my favorite subreddit. I love this community.
Cringe you posted, young Slywalker. Banned from the Ketamine stash, you now are.
400th comment :P
This version of Yoda is really disturbing.
*Produced by the Mary Sue...*

Ironic...
Does yoda also fight Demigorgons in his spare time?
fantastic
its right there, by the busses
Left : Ninja Brian holding back Danny.

Right : Arin "Funneeeee Joke"
Something pristine about this art like it belongs in a church
Hahahahahaha
i can do a yoda voice
Amazing
This is actually the best meme I’ve ever seen
The OC we deserve.
Anakin's face is perfect
ridiculous not to use windu but I understand why
I’m going to send this to my family in a group chat at midnight
*sigh* 

\*unzips pants\*
WTF
Hmmm i feel it should be mace windu here
 But hilarious anyways!
Should've given him rank of master
I need that face on puppet Yoda in ESB
I was here in reddit history Pog
Creepy how accurate this is
Anakin, "This is a sham. How can one be on the Jedi Council and not be a Jedi Master?"
A Masterpiece!
Due to popular demand, I extended my grievous animation and added another lightsaber

We live in a Galactic Empire.

Lower inscription.
I uploaded the original version on my birthday (yesterday), and within 24 hours you guys made it the most upvoted post on this subreddit! I'm ecstatic, thank you all so much. As promised, a version where Grievous swings the lightsabers.
How did you do this without messing up the background??
Truly wonderful the mind of a memer is.
Me trying to handle all my responsibilities
General Grievous: Kills himself and leaves all of those light sabers without an owner

General Grievous searching for new additions to his collection: *HEAVY COUGHING*
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.

Edit: Hilarious my dude, how come no one ever thought to instigate grevious to attack first is beyond me.
Ironic. He could defend from others’ lightsaber attacks, but not from himself.
[Could this be the birth of a new meme template? ](https://imgur.com/fUDC1NM)
Oh it's beautiful.
A very fine addition to this subreddit
He seems to have this under control
I like the *spin* you put on it.. that grevious kills himself
Was I the only one who expected the “other lightsaber” to ignite from his crotch?
Have you heard of the tragedy of General Grievous?

Probably not. It's not a story General Kenobi would tell you. General Grievous was a sith cyborg who took every opportunity to add a fine addition to his collection. Eventually he had so many lightsabers that when he ignited them all, he could blind enemies. His only fear was to get killed and lose his collection. What happened. When he fought General Kenobi, he struck himself down with his own lightsaber. Ironic. He couldn't kill anyone with his entire collection but himself.
How has nobody upvoted this?
"don't try it!"

"You fool!  You underestimate my power!"
That's absolutely perfect lmao

Is a version with sound coming for this one too?
You are wise and powerful and we are very proud of you.
Oh cool I’m seeing a post that’s gonna go to the top of this sub while it’s still in rising. That’s pretty neat. Somebody message me when it reaches the front page or something

Hey /u/Yusi-D-Jordan,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
It's like cutting yourself in half on beatsaber!
Ninja vanish
This is getting out of hand
He's the messiah!
the way he self-destructs is amazing, deserves more upvotes
This is peak prequel memes, it's all downhill from here folks.
Can you add audio effects? That would really make it
u/vredditdownloader
This is the funniest/smartest animation I have seen in forever. This is what Reddit should be for.
Well done.
Hello there!
Death by self-dismemberment.
God bless your heart.
"Hello there" 

"Goodbye"
I'be just woke up the baby laughing out loud. This could be the best thing ever.
This is truly beautiful. I may shed a tear.
I am gonna edit this into the movie and show it to my kids. The movie will skip the fight and just cut to obi-wan saying; “so uncircumcised” and then just continue from there.
Thousands of years from now when aliens are collecting information about the ancient humans of planet earth, this will make a fine addition to their collection.
This dude has so many damn awards he’s gonna have premium for a long time
Add one for ever day of the quarantine
u/Thibson34 would be proud.
Yeah but...it just seems like it's missing something.

&#x200B;

Another lightsaber maybe?

&#x200B;

I mean...to really complete it.
So I don’t understand post karma anymore since you don’t have over 134K karma even though the post has 134K upvotes
If you wanna add one more, a bit of a pause and one opening up after the others would be funny
I love you 

Edit: also happy birthday
Obi-Wan: Well, that was easy.
What lightsaber did you add?
[deleted]
You are DOOMED.

You have done that yourself!
Obi-Wan: Hello there

Grievous: General Kenobi

Obi-Wan: Your move

Grievous: *pulls out 100 lightsabers* lol die

Obi-Wan: Oh shit
Please, for the love of Kenobi, find a way to monetize this... you really deserve it
add another one
Ok, the last one was good, but I laughed my ass off at this one. Thanks!
I wish I could give gold. But I don't do that, so imagine I did as I upvote.
This just keeps getting better
Oh, it's beautiful!
He was killed by his love of lightsabers.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
now that would be a worthy last boss fight....
Beautiful
Blender man
Ouch
This is art
I love this and I’m sure I’m being greedy, but damn I’d love it with sound.
that is a great animation
u/VredditDownloader
it's beautiful. i've looked at this for five hours now.
Obi wan has been the most beloved character of this subreddit for a long time. Now we are seeing his rival reach similar levels of love, and I love it
This made my day.
Wow the amount of credits you made off of this meme!
We will watch your career with great interest
Dude your are king of upvotes

This is incredible
Add one more for each day of quarantine
No this is a 2020 meme!!!
u/vredditdownloader
God bless, this is amazing
And here I was, thinking I knew what perfection looked like...
Takes a lot of patience to do these kind of edits
This fuckin art. All it needs now is sound
Wow that's insane, how long did it take you to animate?
Hello there
This is the highest quality shitpost I've ever seen.
Christmas Trievous
I have never seen that many awards on a post
That was better than the original. Kudos to you, u/Yusi-D-Jordan!
Should've added his Lego death yell at the end lol
Some guy stole this and put it on tiktok, just thought I'd let you know :)
Obi: they got us in the first half, not gonna lie.
Better then TROS.
Win!
Another one to add to my collection
Obi Wan be like: .|.
Another happy landing!
Beautiful
a surprise to be sure but a welcome one
Phenomenal
He's so powerful he transcended the need for a physical form.
Hot
Time to abandon ship
This made me laugh
I cant describe how much i love it
Obi-Wan: *visible confusion*
General Kenobi.
ATTACK KENO-
Oh it’s beautiful
Hello there
You underestimate my photoshop powers!
Nice
Is it possible to learn this power?
General kenobi..
I love this
The power was too much for him.
This is brilliant
r/Unexpected
This is your Magnum opus.
You are a talented one
Helloooooo there.
And I thought it couldn't get better
I thought you were going to add a PP lightsaber. Well, this is fine, too.
This is art. And it got a hearty laugh out of me in a not so great time. Thanks man.
You are a bold one
The dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be..... unnatural.
You are strong and wise and I’m very proud of you
A big part of me hopes it's the second most upvoted.  Imagine that

You’re going to have the top two most upvoted posts on this subreddit now lmfao

My lord! Is that...legal?
Your move...
u/Vredditdownloader
How does it feel to be the owner of the top most of all time?
Holy shit. This is wonderful.
just the perfect amount of funny and cool
THAT ENDING KILLED ME OH MY GOD
I needed this. Thank you
Ironic, he always added a fine addition to his collection, but it was his collection that killed him
Hello there
Its a Disco bot 76
Obi wans just standing there like what the hell just happened
Now witness the power of this fully armed and operational battle station!

Dude this is really cool
this is really cool. Can I get a link to the original?
Is there a version with sound?
I sksksksksk’ed irl
A poignant representation of what star wars has become. I mean really. This is amazing.
Your move
Simply glorious!
Seriously brilliant work, this is my favourite gif now.
You’re as beautiful as the day I lost you
Damn I actually laugh out loud
Give. Us. Moar!
Experience tranquility
Was expecting a cock-sabre. Gotta admit, I’m a little disappointed.
He's like a beautiful Christmas tree... That's also capable of self-defense.
Not even the most advanced AI or most intelligent human could coordinate all these lightsabers at once.
RIP in peace General Grievous
u/vredditdownloader
*directed by Michael Bay*™
So uncivilized
Nice
The lack of audio disturbs me
It hurt itself in its own confusion
You’re shorter than I expected
With sound?

I want to hear Grevious scream!
this is amazing!
Christmas lights
Sound?
Once again fucking amazing :D
I feel bad for grievous thanks to lockdown he can not add to his collection
You're a man of focus, commitment and sheer fucking will.
Happy birthday mate, you and thibson have made this sub Reddit proud
You have too much free time, but at the same time not enough, because I want more.

Great post again.
this looks like a Christmas tree
haha! that's brilliant! Well done 👍
Honestly I dont know what else I was expecting to happen, but it still surprised me.
"The best defense is a swift and decisive offensive"
I love the two droids in the background, one of them says "dude look at General Grievous" and the other is like "sick" then *slowly* turns his head after the slash
you should do this every month lol
So many fine additions
I thought for sure that "another lightsaber" was going to be a slowly growing erection at the end.
Very nice!
Program link
LMAO
that gave me a chuckle. Have an updoot!
Is there a sound version this time?
u/vredditdownloader
Please reanimate this will a roll of toilet paper in each hand.
Laughed until I coughed a ton. This post gave me Rona
r/unexpected
Im going to have to save this it's so good
Nice dude
Did he cut and vaporize himself or is it some kind of teleportation/substitution trick?
I didnt think it was posssible to love this more
Any definition of art should forever just be a link to this.
Me elaborate code when I run it after reading up on various design patterns and articles
u/VredditDownloader
u/vredditshare
This is masterpiece
Too much is too much.

<3
Noice
My kids think this is the funniest thing they've seen all day
Add enough lightsabers that it takes a full minute for ol asthma cyborg to draw them all out.
Thia is hilarious
u/vredditdownloader
After that Obi Wan should deactivate his lightsaber.
That's really good!
You are a bold one!!
You are the hero we need.
The 3rd one from the top on his left doesn't come on :(
With sound?
Grievous, you're clumsier than I expected.
This is so amazing!
Love this. I’d been seeing all kindsa memes with this or the LEGO format and it’s good to finally get context
You have managed to make me change my background for the first time in 5 years! Do you understand how crazy that is and how amazing you are?!
lit af
Goodbye there
We need more!
i love this so much!  
thanks for your effort /u/Yusi-D-Jordan
Congrats. I’ve watched this 15 times in a row. It’s genius. Might I suggest a couple of things for comedic timing? Extend the scene for one second longer after Grevious drops, and in that last second have Obi Wan’s head look down. Then only at the last half second have the droid in the BG look at the other droid.
This one is even better, if i must say...nice job!
Please tell me you have one with sound!!
This is so sick!
HE DID IT. THANK YOU
u/vredditdownloader
What about sound
You are strong and wise, u/Yusi-D-Jordan, and I am very proud of you.
And right when you thought it couldn't get any better...lol
first time i really had to laugh at something coming from this sub. its fking hilarious
My weird ass was expecting a lightsaber dick
u/vredditshare
This is FUCKING TOP NOTCHERY
u/vredditdownloader
Random B-1: "Look like it's my collection now."
Hehehehehehe
An award from a poor man 🏅
The way Obi looks at grievous makes it even funnier lol
u/vredditdownloader
This is quality, thank you.
holy shit this is extremely well done
Even better version
Like a christmas tree
This is amazing, well done my dude!
Is that legal??
My exact expectation
u/Vredditdownloader
please give us more
"I need more high ground"

-Obi-wan, probably
Nice
Ohmyfuck this is amazing
This is legendary.  Absolute king shit
This lad has 69,029 karma we gotta get him 391 more points fellas and not a digit over.
Happy birthday and good job
Just realized the droid in the back nudged the other droid to look lmao
I would love to see the lightsabers spin a bit longer
I always love the droid in the background who nudges his buddy because he knows shits about to pop off.
I don't even watch star wars and this shit is funny
the droids on the back be like: what the fuck is happening
I thought you'd make one light saber emerge like his dick.
Your editing is very impressive, you must be very proud
u/vredditdownloader
Another fine addition if I do say so myself
Ah, Master Kenobi.
*screen wipe*
How many weeks of premium and how many coins do u have now
I like the part where he kills himself.
This was pretty good with all the lightsabers alone, then made me fold like an origami at the end.
Here mom, this man made history
I literally can not stop watching this. It is hands down the best post on this subreddit.
The best part about this is that he kills himself afterwards
Lesson from the Jedi: Simpler is better.
This dude has Reddit premium for at least the next 200 years

This is really fucking good.
I'm not gona lie, I thought the last one was going to shoot out of his groin area.
Lmao. I fucking love you OP. Omg.
Don’t you mean you extended your previous grievous animation?
(Joke)
now make the droids in the background react with some kind of facepalm.
Arms race always ends in destruction.
Hello, the Louvre? Are you accepting GIFs yet?
Dude you are so close to an epic amount of karma. 69,958 rn

Fuck my life. I missed it by one. 69,970. I'm sorry friend.
This is fantastic.
Swiss knife
You missed out on saying your previous grievous animation
Can we get some sound? I wanna hear every lightsaber ignite
Oh, it's beautiful!
Amazing lol. Props for not spoiling the joke with the title.
That is so cool!!
Needs a double saber a la Darth maul
Stop, I can only get so hard
Love it
Due to covid
Another is an understatement
So uncivilized
Lok
Holy shit this is amazing.
That really needs to be made into an actual light up Christmas Wreath. I’d never take it down.
We will watch your career with great interest.
This is the first thing to make me really, genuinely laugh in the last several days. Thank you.
Have to admit had an actual chuckle when he cut himself up.
Can u make one but with obiwan increasing in high ground
Supply and demand.
u/vredditdownloader
I think I'm in love
Thanks for making this. Hilarious!
Amazing lol
General kenobi intensifies
Surprised there isn't an award called, 'A Fine Addition'.
This is great

He only needs to be extended.

I love this
Imagine a General Grievous Force-ghost...
Suicide is badass
"SUP FUCKERS!!!" -obi-wan kenobi
How much would it cost for you to edit Revenge of the Sith so all of Grevious's scenes are done correctly like this?
General Kenobi-AH!
Beautiful, I love it
Nothing gold can last....
Dang. How many arms and sabers did you have to roto for this?  That’s too much work lol
Probably the greatest thing that’ll come from corona virus quarantine season
I'm dying this made me crack up WAAAY too hard
When I try to impress this sub with my art work.

Only screenshots? Only a sith deals in absolutes.
I can hear this meme
Your drawings are very impressive, you must be very proud
I'll take that bet.
Someone put actual effort into a prequel meme they can’t do that shoot them or something
I don't remember this blue fella from the Bible
It’s actually fairly good. Your style is really nice and you definitely got Watto on point!
Nice art, it will be a fine addition to my collection.
Love your artwork
The hand-drawn memes are a pathway to many abilities some consider to be... artistic.
i'm impressed tbh
I love
Where is KENOBI !!!!
I would buy a comic with this style.
This style of drawing is great for prequels memes. There's definitely talent and effort but at the same time some parts have that meme style of being oddly proportioned or warped in the faces. Qui gon's faces here are truly hilarious.
I'll wager you making hot for....ohh...say....the boy and his mother.
100+k upvotes? I have seen this Raw strength only once before.
I will watch your career with great interest.
Hand drawn meme formats? Hand drawn meme formats are no good here, I need something more real.
Damn I really want to do a voice dub of this with my roommate who can do a really good Watto impression
Seriously, how is there this many comments and not more upvotes?
seeing you get over 100k upvotes and countless awards: ironic
Me from the future knowing this is the 6th most upvoted post on r/prequel memes:

Ironic
I wish I had money to give you gold
This post is gonna have really high ground soon...
Ironic
Bro that's hecka good
Your watto is very impressively drawn, you must be very proud.
Is it possible to learn this power?
finally some quality Qui Gon work
One day I want to see a meme that’s hand drawn that isn’t about the fact it’s been drawn
This is where the art begins.
Your drawings are very impressive, you must be very proud.
This could even beat Grievous and its 66 lightsabers.
I don’t remember that scene in the Bible.
Ironic
Drawings are great, but I'm sick of people just making memes about getting upvotes. Those aren't memes.
hey this is great
Your drawings are very impressive, you must be very proud.
This is amazing and i love you
A thing of beauty!

They can't do that! Shoot them... or something.

Can you draw him like a French Girl please
He's to artistic to be alive
Ironic
How about republic upvotes?
What others have you drawn?
Qui-Gon Jesus.
I don’t remember this part in the bible
Oh it’s beautiful
I know, what’s the senate!
This sub’s backalley persona is now officially Watto, change my mind
Ironic.
This IS how memes should be done from now on
Is that... Comic sans?
As this goes into top all of r/Prequelmemes we must remember this was the original and anymore are reposts
oh the irony of this post
*Disagrees in 101k*
Well if it makes you feel better, this is now the 13th most upvoted post of all time on this subreddit! Congrats.
we will watch your career with great interest
Holy shit. This is one of the best submissions ever
You are strong and wise and I am very proud of you.
When this reaches Hot: Ironic
Your drawings are very impressive you must be very proud
I just came here for the first time ever. Sorted by “top all time.”

Ah yes my favorite scene from the Bible.
Well well how the turntables

Just saw a repost of this and learned you were the OOP. Just want to say how cool I think this is! Love the art style, love the work with colors. 🥳

Good artwork!! Is that with colored pencils?
I love this. :D You definitely got Watto down pat too.
Art has the high ground here
At last we will reveal our color palettes to the Jedi.
I shouldn’t. The code forbids it.
Dope.
chic tract energy
That is beautiful
That's awesome dude! Great drawing!
Just watched this today and I can say your drawing is like 1000% accurate and totally amazing!
Qui Gon looks so embarrassed
Hilarious, true art
This might be the only appropriate use of font
“And no *other* sub will upvote prequel drawings, I promise you that!”
I don’t forget.
watto: you can't do that 


OP: oh I don't think so
My lord, is that legal?
Ahh the pen, a more elegant weapon for a more civilized age.
You should have added the last panel as a screenshot
Fucking amazing 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Lmao I love it
Just draw Watto a bunch it’s pure gold
I was expecting Kenobi.  Why are you here?
Is it possible to learn this power?
Yes, of course. As you know these drawings are perfectly legal.
But awards will do fine.

Twice the artistic talent, double the student loan debt.
NUBIAN!!!!
Screenshots? Really? Man of your talents?
Many people find drawings to be... unnatural
Drawings will do fine.
This is a very ugly screenshot
Please draw Mustar obi Ani battle
I like this cartoon style. Well done sir!
u/produc_exe, I was expecting someone of your talent to be...  Popular...
Impressive. Most impressive. (For real though dude this is awesome.)
Humble braggin’
Phew, thought I was dead asleep.
background great, body great, watto great, hair great, but somethings up with quigons face
Qui-Gon looks like a King of the Hill character and I love it
Impressive most impressive
*Only Kenobi!*
I would recommend it, it’s very good.
Anti-Semitic cartoons about Jesus being mistreated smh
This is Fucking awesome. 

- Wanz (Thrift Shop, 2012)
Impressive, you must be proud if your art.
I like this style. It's so classic. It makes me think of children's religious books, which is a neat perspective for the story of a Jedi. I would read more of these.
Yo I thought this was a storyboard at first. Damn son.
/r/bootleg_memes
Capital r, r.i.p
Ironic
Me: *sees 30k upvotes*

How ironic
Reading it in Watto's voice made it amazing to me
r/foundthemobiledrawer
I initially thought this was Watto talking to Jesus
Is it possible to learn this artistic power?
Trying to use your artistic tricks in this subreddit? You are a bold one
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
It's cause you're using Comic Sans
looks like this could be used for meme formats
I literally watch this movie a few hours ago with my fiancee!
Your art has grown too.  Grown more beautiful I mean.
I heard his voice
What about the drawing memes of the wookies?
I thought that was Jesus and that I was on a different page
I don’t forget.
I don’t think he is
I'm from /all and I legitimately thought this was supposed to be Jesus 🙏
How many other lies have I been told by the council?!
I see great potential in your future.
Why are you people uovoting this!
The joke was so good and well executed it cancelled everything else out
Nice posting a comic strip. Comic strips aren't memes
I’m conflicted,  to say the least...
Oh, I thought I was dead asleep.
They hated Jesus because he spoke the truth.
This is the art you are looking for. 
+ This is the art we are looking for.
Now this is Pod Racing
I read that in his voice but those are not the lines.
Can we pay for your artwork with Republic credits
I don’t think he is
Why is jesus talking to a seedy Toydarian? Is this a crossover episode
Ironic
May the Force be with you for using Comic Sans correctly.
I like it, I like it a lot. But it looks like you spent about 5x as much time on the blue dide compared to Que-gon lol. That first panel makes me think of a 60's Scooby-Doo cartoon
Looks nice, like stuff they use for the concept art for the pitch nice.
Qui-Gon's face is just "Drat, foiled again!"
It’s a trick! Send no reply.
Post many more you will, tons of upvotes you will have
Jesus Christ meets an avatar. (The blue guys with the tail sex)
This is some of the best content we've seen here in a while. I love the expressions, they really jump off the page. Well done
Artwork doesn’t work on me only Obi -Wan
Counterpoint: when you try to clean up.
Weird. Literally just watched this for the second time in my life today since it came out.
Bravo!
50% of this upvote is from spite
I came back two hours later and 50.5K upvotes. Great job getting this far my dude!
This is top tier.
Phew, thought I was dead asleep.

It's a trick. Send no upvotes!

Tracing paper leads to abilities some consider unnatural.
A starving artist
No drawing is worth 2 karma, not by a longshot!
HAHAHAHAHAHA HOLY SHIT Qui-Gon's pout in the last pic
That wasn't very Republic Credits of you
This meme will make a fine addition to my collection.
Oh, I thought I was dead asleep.
nice very much nice
That is genuinely hilarious!
From the first panel I thought this was from r/comics and it was another Jesus comic. Then I noticed the sub name.
dude made a biblical children's book
We'll let chance decide. Blue, get reported, red... upvote.
Could you draw the scene with the chance cube? I say it so often to my wife while rolling a d20. She hates it and doesn’t even understand it.
The negotiations were short
Dude.. I thought this was a cartoon about Jesus hahahaha. Had to look twice. Good job 👍
But my lord, is that, legal?
You draw very well. Whatever you’re doing, keep at it!
This is beautiful and in no way reminds me of sand
I read these in wato's voice. I cant be the only one I hope.
Oh, I thought I was dead asleep.
This is amazing
65k upvotes in 4 hours?? I underestimated the power of this subreddit
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!

Now you’re better than this.
By only screenshots you mean Kenobi right?
Qui-Gon will do fine.
This is quality shit right here man. Good work.

Well it is a screen shot of the real world.

This is amazing
You damn well know that you’ll get upvotes for this.
I can hear their voices speak in this
Great job in this. I totally heard both voices!
Ironic...
We need more TPM content, so thanks! Cool art!
Disney+ wants to block screenshots of star wars scenes? Fine. We'll draw our own scenes. With blackjack. And hookers.
Thise will make a fine adetion to my collection
ironic
I wish I could give this a thousand likes!!!
Oh, I thought I was dead asleep.
Love the art, if only this wasn’t for karma lol
Fucken amazing dude!!!!!
Wow. Great art, great meme. You have my praise.
That’s actually pretty good
10 OUT OF FUCKING 10!!!
I guess we’re all simple minds then cause it worked
And she comes home with a red lightsaber
Love how the last panel looks like Qui Gon is watching the upvotes increase.
That’s a lot of awards
I’m guessing those awards will make a fine addition to your collection?
Sure is a lot of upvotes . Ironic...
And no one else has any upvotes, I promise you that.
Nice
That hidden face on the top right is nightmare fuel
Cheers bro. I'll upbote that.
Someone tell me why i read only  "no they won't" in watos voice
I am down voting because its true.

Edit: i upvoted
I know, what’s the senate!
Wow an appropriate use of comic sans, we will watch your career with great interest.
This is good art.
It seems in the end your artist tricks worked

Wow great.
Half this sub is low effort crap, heres my upvote for taking time into making quality

This might hit 100,000 upvotes...
Anyone else hearing Take On Me as the background music for this? Just me?
Now this is absolutely EPIC

How opd are u ?
I don’t know what day it was.
She can’t do that! Upvote her or something!
What would you expect from guy, who lives in vast desert in the middle of space, in planet where according to Lego Star Wars, has cents as currency? just look at the financial logo in Pod race stage cutscene. so i guess the economy is so horrible on Tatooine, that cents are the only currency there
Congrats on getting over 100k upvotes. Was it a piece of cake?
As a reply on the bottom left: r/foundthemobileuser
I guess you're going to r/eternityclub and r/silverclub

Where is this on madlads?
108k lol
Listen man, I know this may sound weird, but could you please make some juicy rule 34 of Watto? This drawing already got me so hard after seeing Watto's sexy, blue, wrinkly alien face and I can't stop here, please
amazing drawing
Really good drawing deserved this many upvotes
You underestimate my power!

Rest in Peace, Grant Imahara.

No way, I only knew him from Mythbusters. Had no idea he worked on Star Wars and no idea he had passed. RIP
I thought this was a hoax,, but I Googled it, and it wasn't :( I'm sad. He was my favorite Mythbuster.

RIP grant.
[deleted]
Makes me wish Force ghosts were real
How did he die?
Goodbye old friend
You are not on this planet, but we do grant you the rank of master
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Omg... I can’t believe this is how I found out about his passing. Such a tragic loss for the industry and pop culture community.

Thanks for the hard work, Grant. Rest in Peace.
No fucking way. This dude from myth busters also worked on star wars? And now he's dead? Wtf 2020. May he rest in peace.
Grant was a role model for so many, including myself. Seeing an Asian on TV helped to fuel my passion for science and engineering, and definitely had an influence for getting me to where I am today.

This just hurts.

May the Force be with him always.

Feels so unreal, he was the youngest male Mythbuster. And he was such a big part of my childhood. He seemed like such a down to earthlink and nice guy as well.
RIP Grant. You will always be remembered. Thank you for all the great memories, from mythbusters to star wars, you were amongst the best. May the force be with you.
Oh shit, seriously!! Knew his from Mythbusters, that dude seemed so nice
He is one with the force now.
He was a great man. My favorite of his creations would have to be Craig Ferguson’s robot skeleton sidekick, Geoff Peterson. Sad to hear he passed.
He gave me so many hours of entertainment as a child in mythbusters do sad to see him go rest in peace
Nooooooo.

I was so shocked and thought this was a shitpost because I couldn't believe it at first so I looked it up.
Just realized he was born the same date as I. Gonna drink to him now on every birthday to honor what a legend he was.
R,i,p,
He was such an inspiration to so many people, me included. Rest In Peace King
The white rabbit project was my favorite. Sucks to know he's gone. Hope he's doing just fine now
There goes a big part of my childhood. Fuck 2020
Whaaaaat?! He actually passed away?! That’s horrible, oh my gosh. I remember watching him on Mythbusters a long time ago, this is really sad.

I also had no clue he was R2 in the prequels, that makes me love him, R2, & the prequels even more. I thought Kenny Baker was R2’s actor.
He has become more powerful that we could ever be.
Goodbye, old friend. May the Force be with you.
Rest In Peace my man. You gave me plenty of happy memories between Star Wars and myth busters. 

Hope you get your rest king!
R.I.P
Thank you for Co hosting one of my best childhood show, Rest in Peace
Wow. I only knew him from the White Rabbit Project and Mythbusters, but that is so sad to see.
And now is watch has ended

Wrong sub, butt fuck it!
Oh he was a SW fan as well? 

Both "Star *" communities lost a great man yesterday. What a shame...
I grew up watching him and the rest of the Mythbusters in the mid 2000s, they made me love science and he was one of my faves, gonna miss you buddy rest up man...
I grew up watching him on Mythbusters, this somehow hurts more than when Carrie Fisher died.

Goodbye, my old friend, and may the force be with you.
Fuck. Mythbusters was one of my favorite show as a kid and is probably one of the reason why i got into physics, and Grant was probably my favorite of the ''B team''. May he rest in peace.
I usually pass off celebrity deaths by saying "I never knew this guy, so why do I care?" but man, hearing this literally made me sad that I would want to cry. The only time I felt really sad for a celebrity like this was when Chester Bennington died. Goddamnit I'm gonna miss this guy for real. Now every time I would watch a mythbusters clip, it would remind me that I won't see this guy in television or anywhere else again. RIP Grant, thank you for giving me all the fond memories from all the myths you've busted and cleared.
The force will be with him. Always
He would've really appreciated this mark of respect. Thanks for doing this, OP.
Shows we're a hell of a lot better when i was growing up. Learned a lot from Mythbusters. RIP Grant Imahara, gone too soon.
Ah what the fuck. Can't believe this is how I find out. RIP Grant
As if 2020 couldnt get any worse
May the force be with you
All the Jedi would be dead of if weren’t for Grant. Imma give this big F
2020 has officially gone too far.
I grew up watching the mythbusters. I loved every episode. Sending thoughts to his family. May he Rest In Peace
And now I'm gonna be sad for the rest of the day
GRANT IS DEAD!????? I loved watching him in mythbusters and i had no idea he worked on r2-d2 in the prequels. Rest In Peace, you will be missed.
Good bye old friend. May the force be with you
Celebrity deaths don’t really mean much to me usually. 

This one hurt. This man helped start my love for learning. RIP to a real hero.
F
:( Nooo why man please tell me this a joke pls no man I'm gonna miss him so bad R.I.P Grant Imahara
He honestly was a huge part of my childhood. Rest In Peace and hope his family and friends are healthy and well during this rough time
Asians represent !!!! 😢😢😢😢😢 RIP
That’s a real shame
I now Grant you the rank of master
Damn, Grant. I remember seeing you on Mythbusters, and now you get to live on in the hearts of prequel memers.
Nothing but respect for him Really liked him RIP
I didn’t know this. I’m even more sad now.
In the words of Darth Vader: Nooooooooooooooooo.   


Seriously though, remember that time he tried to make the equivalent of an at st so that they could smash it with a log. that was cool.
This dude was and still is one of my role models, I remember coming home from school every day then doing homework while watching Mythbusters, on the white rabbit project he always had the coolest stuff to show and just now I learn he worked on star wars. Damn what a guy so sad that he passed.
I really thought you were making a joke, google isn't laughing.
He died?!?!??!?!?? Noooooooo
WAIT, HE'S DEAD?!?!?!?!

#NOOOOOO
This just came out of nowhere. I loved Mythbusters growing up. He was only 49.

Goodbye, old friend.
He's testing the myth that there's an afterlife. See you there, grant. May the force be with you. Always.
Goodbye old friend, may the force be with you.
I had no idea he passed away, he was my favourite on mythbusters and he was only 49! So sad man RIP Grant
Ah man, he was my favorite mythbuster. Hopefully he is making robots in a better place.
This is heartbreaking, I loved his work on Mythbusters, one of the coolest shows growing up as a kid, and he worked on Star Wars! Building my childhood on and off the screen, Rest In Peace Grant.
This guy and the rest of the Mythbusters team were a critical part of my childhood.
Goodbye, old friend. May the Force be with you.
Everything I love is crumbling in 2020...
I don't have any hope anymore.
So long old friend may the Force and Buster by with you!
Man wasn’t he married? Shit, this sucks
When someone asked if I heard about him, I was worried he was outed as a pedophile or something, but this felt much worse, gone too soon ❤️
Honestly FUCK 2020 this year keeps getting worse and worse
Hail the victorious dead.
He was also on battlebots with deadblow one of the greats and will be sorely missed
Well... f@#$ ... I loved the guy for his brilliant engineering skills and passion for robotics, he got me interested in robotics and engineering and to learn he died that's... just... f@#$ing f@#$er of a f@#$ing c&*%muffin wombat-f@#$er universe taking the guy... I can't stop crying.
To all the people calling OP a karma whore for posting this shut up. He has a two year old account and only has like 10k karma he is obviously not whoring and it only takes five seconds to find out
I only wish he was alive today to see the 121k upvotes. He would have loved that.
I loved him on Mythbusters and like many on here didn’t know he was R2 in the Prequels! Whenever he was on screen when we were watching Mythbusters, my husband would say, There’s your boyfriend!” And I would say, Yes, yes he is. And Grant was my pretend boyfriend for those minutes, not in a weird way but in an appreciable way. Taken from us too soon, he will be so missed by so many.
You are one with the force the force is with you.
He didn't just operate R2. He was the technician that automated him to be controlled remotely. R2 in the OT required someone inside for operation.
Mythbusters was my shit back in the day, this one hit hard
Mythbusters was my whole childhood, what  a nice guy he seemed to be on TV. RIP Grant
We lost a good one today folks.
He operated my second-favourite droid. R.I.P
Not gonna be able to think about anything else. Man
....
grant is dead? how? he was such a chill dude.
Rest in peace  Grant , you amazing person
*Sad R2D2 noises*
First TKOR, and now a mythbuster.

This universe takes the best Grants away from us. We didn’t deserve their talents
The Force will be with you, always.
He made me interested in science, and with that I became interested in astronomy, he was the main reason I was passionate about calculus and mathematics, one of the best presenters of the mythbusters, rest in peace Grant.
His work was such a big part of my childhood. Mythbusters and Star Wars. 

49 is too soon.
Goodbye old friend, and may the force be with you
I'm sure when he reads this from Reddit in heaven, he will appreciate the thanks
Yep. 2020 has gone way too far.
This guy seemed genuinely excited about life and his work. When I watched him on Mythbusters teaching me about the current project, I genuinely listened because of his excitement and passion. He died way to young.
Oh God...
I'm always sad when a person I've been inspired by dies, but in this case it's even more devastating since he was so young and could have achieved so much more.
RIP Grant!!!
He was a great guy and an awesome engineer. Thanks for everything.
I met Grant at the Punkin Chunkin event (used to be on SyFy every Thanksgiving). I was running for student representative at the time, and walked up to him to ask for an “endorsement” on video. He didn’t even hesitate and thanks to Grant, I won that election. A truly genuine, kind, guy. This sucks.
I can’t believe Grant’s dead. Goodbye old friend, and may the Force be with you.
Oh my god he died ?
Legends never die
*General Salute!* Geekdom has lost a bright star. You will be remembered warmly. Farewell Grant may you Rest in Peace.
Damn this is the first I’ve heard of this. So sad 😭
Covid?
Rest In Peace
Beep boop, Grant. Beep boop.
*sad R2D2 noises*
Hold on what? What the fuck 2020
This is how I found out. I would have had it no other way.
I've been impressed that Grant did volunteer work with student robotics clubs well after he was famous and at times when it seemed like he must have been incredibly busy. He will be missed by so many in so many ways.
N-no, this can't be...
I’m thankful for the time we got with him.
May he Rest In Peace and may the force be with him
Oh my, this is the first I’m hearing of his passing. 

I frickin’ loved him on Mythbusters and now I’m incredibly sad.
No way! This is really sad. He did a video series on Youtube for The Verge once and it was really good. Seemed to be a great guy with a passion for technology. Really sad to see him go. May the force be with him.
How did he die?
I love and will miss you so much, Grant.
“Peace, love, and in the frozen isles.
F
F for Respects 😥
F
He will be missed,I rewatch myth busters all the time. This blows my mind.
What was the cause of his death?
For those of you wondering, he died suddenly from a brain aneurysm. 

Rest in Peace, Grant. You won't be forgotten.
R.I.P
A peas of my child hood just die RIP
Rip
wtf he was in two of my favorite sci fi universes and mythbusters
WHAT
May the force be with you old friend
F
Through the force no one is truly gone, only within us does their spirit lives on
I thought it was a midget in the trash can. 

“You can’t - have - a robot - because then the - wobbles - wouldn’t be - right”

I don’t know why I gave the old R2 actor the Eric the Midget voice but I did
This is not qhY I expected to read this morning. He was a big part of my childhood, and is part of why I love science and robotics. Goodbye. The world won't be the same without you.
RIP
Sad R2 noises.
The guy who doesn’t post a meme on a meme page gets 100k upvotes
F
Fuck aneurisms
Damn... I’m gonna miss that boy..
What he worked on r2 d2 and on mythbusters this guy is a legend I hope he rests in peice
F
🥺
\#F
I ran into him at Comic-Con. Stopped to take a picture with me even though he was in a super big rush to get somewhere. Really nice guy.
Rip grant, my favorite myth buster as a child, what a guy.
F
Rest in peace. He will forever be known as a legendary man.
Bruh, he passed away on my sister’s birthday. RIP
Holy crap this man is a legend
He was also a devoted Trekkie
I didn’t know he worked in star wars, I loved him on myth busters and white rabbit. He was awesome. RIP
R.I.P Grant. You were loved and will be missed.
Thank you Grant
Woke up this morning to the news of his death. I knew most of his work and he was always such a nice guy and a touch of fresh air wherever he was. Rest in peace Grant... you left us too early 💔
F
F
Carefully, he’s a hero
F
Rest in Peace sir, and may the force and God above both be with you
Rest in greatness.
The fallen shall forever be remembered as the emperor's finest
Goodbye old friend my the force be with you.
I remember watching myth busters with my grandpa 2 days before he died,it’s a real shame that he died,what did he die from?
And only 49, the world fucking sucks.
F
What happened to him?! He was amazing!
F
Thank you, Grant. RIP.
Oh man really!? 
R.I.P
F
Oh no.
This is how I learned Grant passed away.
Aw man I didn’t know he passed. That sucks :(
Fuck you brain aneurysms!
2020, you just took it way too far
It was so much fun watching Mythbuster with him on the team, sadly this is the end... RIP
F
Goodbye, old friend. May the force be with you.

RIP bro ✌🏻
Wasn't he on myth busters too?
Do you have a link?
The man lived a life most of us nerds have wet dreams over.

F
No. F
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
WHY does 2020 SUCK SO BAD
May the Force be with him

Rest in Peace Mythbuster
May the force be with you, Grant
Oh god I just heard about this-
He was a good guy
rip mr imahara, you were  strong and we are very proud of you .
Wait what!?
Rest In Peace grant. You did great work and you’ll be missed
Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force.
people making huge posts about travoltas wife? But not about him? Half my youth is mythbusters.
We'll always remember Grant for his work and for his actions. Rest In Peace, Soldier 💙
Whatttt no noooo
Thank you Grant for your work and for my adolescent memories. It'll be immortalized in American culture. Requescant en pace.
He really was an incredible guy.
is he the guy from mythbusters?
This is sad, easily my favourite from the myth busters and I loved the White Rabbit Project. Sad to see him go.
Holy... I didn't know...

Rest in peace, Grant Imahaea.
Rest in peace buddy!
May the force be with you
Fuckin hell what a fuckin loss
This news hits hard man. Goddamn.
Rest in piece, may you always take R2D2 the way which is far to rocky
“If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine” - Grant Imahara
Holy shit. I used to love mythbusters when it was airing and really liked Grant. RIP
Wait what the fuck?? He died???
:(
Not like this grant
Nooooooooo!!!! Grant!!!!!
Can you imagine if he had entered one of his battle bot tournaments with an r2 unit though?
This is bullshit. fuck..
TF!?!  Dude wasn't that old!  What happened?
*sad R2-D2 noises* 😔
RiP
He seemed like such likable person and just so down to earth. I don’t think truly there was anyone who disliked him. Strokes cause trouble for millions of familys worldwide. He will be dearly missed.
Wait. He's dead? My childhood is slowly falling apart.
wtf he died just yesterday (13th july). Holy crap.....RIP man
Goodbye old friend, may the force be with you
This one hits so fucking hard
RIP
May the force be with you, always
Rest in peace, you brought many smiles on my face I er the years and many others.
Rest in peace
May The Force be with him. Always!
First Rick May, now my favourite droid and myth buster dies? Fucking hell
R.I.P Mr Sulu
Seemed like he could be my cool older brother first time I watched the mythbusters. This is sad.
Oh no hes dead? Grew up watching mythbusters
He was a massive part of my childhood growing up from Mythbusters and Star Wars. He will be missed, but his legacy has and will inspire many. RIP
I happened to be listening to C418-Sweden. This makes it 5x more sad
This photo hit harder than the others. A man achieving a dream he had as a kid. Let his death be a celebration for his achievement and a reminder to chase your dreams no matter how silly it may be. Yes even playing a robot in a space movie.
Wow awesome!, TIL!

Sad day, always loved how much he tried to explain to the camera what he was doing and the physics principles behind it, without talking down to the audience.(on MythBusters)
May the force be with you.
Is this real?
Wow. Seemed like a really cool guy. Condolences to his family and friends. 😢
May your soul rest in peace Grant.
Woah, he was everywhere.
He died on my birthday.... Fuck....
I had no goddamn idea. Really bums me the fuck out.
RIP, man... :( didn’t even hear about this. Dammit.
Rip
Jesus fucking christ no...
Legit just ruined my night :( what a good dude.
Thank you and May the Force be with you.
Ugh.. why did I hit the /all button.. Fuck 2020.
I’m not ready for this one :(
RIP, He was a big part of my childhood
May the force be with you..
Thank you for your contribution to the world ❤️
What the fuck. This is heartbreaking. I loved mythbusters so much growing up, watching the trio was always so fun and chaotic. What a sad day
WHAT?!?!, NOOO?! HOW
How did he die?
Grant is an inspiration. I remember watching Mythbusters at the age of 10 and thinking that everything Grant did was the most amazing thing I'd ever seen. They were like a band of superheroes, and Grant was the one I looked up to most. I also remember one time that he happened to be at the same convention/competition I was at as a teenager, and I desperately wanted to meet him, but I just barely missed him. I hoped one day to meet him, but it was not destined for this life. I wish the best to his family and loved ones and offer my condolences. You will be missed Grant.
Wait, grant died?
idk if people will remember, but he built Geoff Peterson the gay robot skeleton on the late late show. Brings back lots of memories for me. It's too bad that he passed away so suddenly.
Deadblow was always my favorite Battlebot. Sad to see Grant go.
FUCK
Beep boop:(
He’s one with the force now, Rest In Peace Grant
He was only 49. *Forty-nine*. It's awful.
Fuck 2020.
Gave me so much inspiration and entertainment as a kid. Feels like I’ve lost a friend
All reports say that he "died suddenly"

My only hope is that he didnt feel any pain. May the force be with him
Damn that Really Hit Tho
WHAT THERES NO WAY THIS IS REAL MAN NO
I didn’t know this what the hell he always seemed like a great guy in myth busters that’s sad rip
I don't really like the star wars movies to be honest, but imahara was really a nice guy that gave my Sunday afternoons a lot of shine with mythbusters.
OMG he died. It is a shock. RIP.

He was great.
*Sad beep*
2020 has taken it too far. I’ve been a huge MythBusters fan ever since I was little
Rip good guy
What a legend. He will be missed, and his legendary work will never be forgotten. Not to mention the countless kids who were inspired to love science because of his role in MythBusters, he will forever live in our hearts.
I hope you’ll still be busting myths in the after life old friend!

I always looked up to him and he’s the reason I wanted to become a robot engineer
God damn, another lost legend.
Shit dude Rest In Peace. You were great on mythbusters and, evidently, in Star Wars.
RIP💙💙💙
Damn : ( such talent, i have very fond memories of watching mythbusters and the parts with him. Sad to seem him pass
Seriously, fuck this year.

RIP.
A great man.
This year is hot garbage.
The world is burning.
RIP
Is it just me or is this year not going well?
I am absolutely devastated.. 2020 went full fuq everyone mode. He was such a nice guy..

There's some kind of magic here, it's unmistakable. People like to take big ol shits on posts like these for their low effort nature, yet when a community comes together for something like this it's so out of the ordinary that one can't help but wonder whether or not there's some sort of genuinity past the shitposty feel of posts of this sort. 

I genuinely believe that not only will this be a massive part of the community's history, it will also end up being a source of unity that can be called upon in times of strife.

What if /u/Diesalk9 is really sent from /r/sequelmemes and this is his plan to infiltrate our senate but nobody suspects anything and he gains ultimate power ^just ^^like ^^^jarjar 
I'll try shitposting! That's a good trick!
ARE WE BLIND? DEPLOY THE UPVOTES!!!
I have to admit that without the clones, there would not have been victory 
WE STILL NEED MORE UPVOTES! DEPLOY THE GARRISON!
Always 131.072 of them there are. No more, no less
WHY IS THIS STILL WORKING

WHY AM I STILL UPVOTING THESE
Commenting for the history....
Keep it going!
We now have a chance to achieve it
After a 1000 years we will finally get to 131.072 Upvotes.
We need 15k upvotes
I've been waiting for 3years, can we make it happen before the end of 2021, folk?
The time of Rice is now, old man
For some reason this post has a 92% vote ratio while the rice one has a 70%. That means in terms of upvote they are actually very close
It could still happen
We are about to achieve our goal 4 years later. Will we see 262,144 Ewans???
CONTINUE THE UPVOTES
Wait if this happens would mods ban the next ewan post
Good soldiers follow orders
TFW this post becomes the top post of all time on r/prequelmemes because of a low effort Pewdiepie reaction video.
It is critical we get the sequel to this post immediately
Now this is shitposting!!!!!!!!!!
They're still coming through!
Shitposting is a pathway to levels of karma some consider unnatural.
NOW WITNESS THE UPVOTES OF THIS FULLY ARMED AND OPERATIONAL SUBREDDIT
I was hoping each picture would be full size, and this picture would be like, 2.8 petabytes.
I think its worth mentioning that this is basically the point where you've won.

But good luck. You're a legend if you can hit the final threshold here.
Lets do it boys!!
DEPLOY THE UPVOTES
Master moderators what do we do? There are too many of them!
Missing some upvotes master /u/Diezlk9 is. How embarrassing...*how* embarrassing.
Ewan to keep going with this whilst you can !
So this is how no rules day dies... with thunderous upvoting.
I'm just here to upvote
I just got reddit so...”This is where the fun begins.” ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
Good, good. Now UPVOTE him, UPVOTE him now. Do it!
Good effort lads
[deleted]
4 years late but I want to see this post limp over the finish line
Only 8k more upvotes!
It’s ricing time
can this post make it before the rice-post though?
Google long-term goals
Just gonna prepare you. You might have to continue very soon. There came an influx through a similar post-chain with rice from r/AnarchyChess
Came here from r/anarchychess
I hope OP is ready, it's happening
Holy hell it's happening
So close !!
ITS ALIVE! ITS ALIVE 🙌

So this is how r/prequelmemes dies, with Thounderous shitposting

This is the hero the galaxy needs, but doesn't deserve.
When I saw this I thought u/Diezlk9 was declaring war on the mods.
May the force be with you Diezlk9
I thought it wasn’t loading for like 20 seconds until I decided to zoom in... I then started spinning cuz I heard it was a good trick 
I know full and goddamn well there are enough people here to make this happen. Do your civic duty. 
I mean, me, too, thanks. 
I dont get whats happening but im jumping on board.

Oddly specific
It has been over three years, But we can still do it
We're close
Cmon guys we can dew it
Come on brothers! Only 7 thousand more upvotes to go!
One day... One day it will be done and we would see 262,144 Ewans...

Can't tell if the last 72 are done, but the 131k is done though.
Update?
We did it!
I came here because of PewDiePie.
Only 73% have upvoted. Over a *quarter* of the views on this have been negative towards the post. Yes, i resent him for getting the karma. I'm sure we all do. But what the hell? UPVOTE THIS
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

u/vredditdownloader
I’m surprised I haven’t seen more of this kind of thing given that the source footage is literally filmed on front of a blue screen.
We are all anakin in this trying time, and god is Obi wan
Quarantine be bringing out the best from these artists.
meme de la meme
This is the way
Obi-wan robbed and lefted Anakin to burn to death on Mustafar then kidnapped his son brainwashed him and trained him to assassinate his own father. And now you're telling me that Obiwan did this while on a speeder laughing like a sociopath! How is Darth Vader the villian in all of this?
For a thousand generations the jedi knights were the guardians of vibin out
Brilliant
This is BEAUTY
i'm amazed by how well you made the lighting match, good job
Watch this get stolen by tik tok
See you in Mustafar
Wtf is with this sub lately? 

Is this really where the fun begins?
Happy high ground noises
Me on my way to my essential job.
Its lit
I just shidded, farded and camed my pants
It it would cut to dramatic music when it shows Anakin I think it could add something.
When you have no attachments chopping off your best friends limbs and leaving him to burn to death on a volcano is not something that can ruin your day.
My first thought was "fuckin dope roto work" my second was "you must be off work"
This is easily some of the funniest shit I’ve ever seen in my life
"my creme de la meme"

I feel like there’s been a recent surge in memes with high quality VFX and I love it

Song: opa blia- hard bass school
I absolutely love that Obi-Wan is blasting hard bass while looking down on Anakin frying like a burnt pancake
I'm drunk and this is amazing thank you very much sir
How did you even make this?
You're a good man. Thank you.
This is without a doubt the funniest star wars gif i have ever seen. Everytime i watch it i cant help but bust out laughing!

Thanks to the quarantine, this sub has been filled with top quality memes. You are strong and wise, and I'm very proud of you.
This subreddit has made me laugh so hard in the last week my ribs hurt and has woken my house up in the morning from laughter twice.

Beautiful. Upvote and saved. This musn't be lost.
Meme de la meme
Hello there
Me n the boys enjoying the every post unarchive while it lasts
OMG 😆
Anakin, start panakin. My ridakin has surround soundakin
This is the top tier shitposting I like to see
I think Kreia would approve leaving the burning man be, would cause more harm to help him
wow
"I hate you!!"
The force is strong in this quarantine. A powerful Sith you will become.
Lol it’s good enough to be in the actual movie
The view is lit!
Now this is quality content.
Always with the highground.
All it needs is some upbeat music to go with it.
Another happy landing
HARD BASS
Anakin: From my point of view the jedi are evil 
Obiwan: From my point of view...no wait it's too high I can't see shit

Creme de la creme got me
He looks so pleased with himself.
He do be vibin doe 😳
Leave him or we’ll never make it
Your video is very impressive, you must be very proud
I regret that I have but one updoot to give.
Is it possible to learn this power?
Creme de la meme
Isolation really is providing quality content
This is what I’m going to tell my kids Star Wars was

I recognised the hard bass immediately… I have a problem.
God damn that's the hardest I've laughed in a while
Better than the sequel
Truly a masterpiece

oh its beautiful
This is where the fun- I don't wanna hear anymore about Obi-wan
This is why I love this sub
Holy shit yes!
Honestly, I'm surprised this hasn't been done more. So much blue screen in these movies, and with all the funny outtakes. There is so much potential for memetic fuckery
Slav intensifies
We need a version where he is playing Higher Ground by Stevie Wonder
Give me more!
That rich kid Obi-Wan is a dick!
This deserves 100k upvotes
This feels like what George imagined Episode 3 to be when filming Episode 1.
Art just art
Why is the initial background being played backwards?
Where is the kenobi clip from?
Woah dude. Top notch.

Edit: u/likeonions, make it a loop and upload it to  r/gifsthatkeepongiving!!

So much giving right here
Oooh it's blyatiful!
"I HATE YOU!"

*"WHAAAT??"*

Nice
Obi Wan vibing to hardbass was the greatest thing I've seen today.
Should have had Mr.Sandman music other than that perfecto
Corona virus: “I have brought great memes, and justice to r/prequelmemes”
Is he... still alive?
Now this...is podracing!
Hardbass!
Can I get "Wake me up before you go go" as the music instead?
What's the gif music combiner bot? This needs to be set to the intro of the song wake me up before ya go go by George Michael
...of the chess world in show with everything, but Yul Brynner.
Hey look? Guys! It’s Оби-Ван кеноби!
u/vredditdownloader
Is it just me or did the meme quality really shoot up during the pandemic?

 And happy cake day!
u/vredditdownloader
*I hate it when he does that*
THIS IS AMAZING!

"Hey Anakin, while you're down there, do the worm!"
This is it. The prequel meme of all prequel memes.
This might be my new favorite replacing the one where he is flying over vietnam with helis and bombings in the background

The most beautiful thing I have ever seen simply put.
It's about damn time someone edited that green screen clip
Oh that’s hot. That’s real hot

WTF? I mean that in an affectionate way.
This was your focus. Everything else, a means to an end.
Never fly on a deathstick trip
u/vredditdownloader
Lmao, pure gold

Points off for not using Da Dip from Auralnauts video
Look alive

This has earned the spot of saved on my reddit profile, well done!! I don’t got any money to take my virtual metal: 🥇
Someone: magnum opus

Ok but can we get a montage of Obi cruising over like every uncomfortable part of the prequels.
I’ve found my new favourite prequel meme
Now replace the song for “I’m feeling hot hot hot” 😅
Is it possible to learn this vibe?
Where can I find a never ending loop of this? Can someone be my hero?
u/vredditdownloader
Excellent work, Iago.
I will do what I must.
