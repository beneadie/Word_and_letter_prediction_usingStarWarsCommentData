(90 of my suggestions have been used).  holy shit you could not have done anything better for the last day. this is the smash ultimate roster of finales! *they're all here!*  thank you to everyone who saw my lists and made a suggestion, especially to those who made great canon suggestions i needed! and to those who made legends suggestions, they weren't forgotten! i made a legends list for april fools day.  and a massive thanks to u/thibson34 for everything. i\n"
